Wanted to see if I could create an action battle system similar to Pokemon from scratch. This is my attempt.

## To Do's
- Turn system
- Opponent "AI" (opponent auto attack)
- Leveling system
- Temperament system (rock, paper, scissors-esque)
- Healing/Regen?
- Skills
- More Opponents
- Pretty-fy
    - view dmg dealt
    - literally anything so it's not two images with some buttons

## Stretch Goals
- Skill tree (lol)
